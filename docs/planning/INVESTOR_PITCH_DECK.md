## Slide 2: The Problem

### Research Commercialization is Broken

**For Innovators (Startups, Researchers, TTOs):**
- ❌ **23-38+ hours** to evaluate ONE research opportunity
- ❌ **$50K-$200K** for consultant-led market analysis
- ❌ **Weeks to months** to get actionable insights
- ❌ **Subjective** evaluation criteria
- ❌ **Limited access** to investor networks

**For Investors (VCs, Corporates, Angels):**
- ❌ **Overwhelming volume** of research to review
- ❌ **Lack of standardized** evaluation metrics
- ❌ **Difficulty assessing** technical + commercial viability
- ❌ **High due diligence costs** ($10K-$50K per deal)
- ❌ **Miss opportunities** due to information asymmetry

**Market Pain:**
- $2.4T spent on R&D globally
- <3% commercialization success rate
- 97% of research never reaches market

   - Market Opportunity (20 pts)
   - Competitive Position (15 pts)
   - IP Landscape (10 pts)
   - Risk Assessment (5 pts)
4. **Marketplace** connects high-scoring research with investors
5. **Deal Flow** facilitation and tracking

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ AI-powered (Claude 3.5 Sonnet + LangGraph)
